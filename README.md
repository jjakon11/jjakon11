# Good Morning ðŸ‘‹

Good morning is always the best way to start the day.

I am Chen-Chia Ku, a postdoctoral scholar at Utah State University. I've been working in the R environment for almost 10 years, yet I still feel like a beginner in this field. Recently, I've started using GitHub for version control, which is quite new to me. I'm grateful to have your support and am eager to create more public repositories with course content to share my work openly.

Need an updated CV? Please refer to my personal [website](https://www.chenchiaku.com) â€”itâ€™s the best place to learn more about me.
